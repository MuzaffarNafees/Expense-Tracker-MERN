# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Expensify - An Expense Tracker

Expensify is a web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack, designed to manage daily expenses in a more efficient and organized manner. The primary goal of Expensify is to provide an easy-to-use platform to track various types of expenses, reducing manual calculations, and enabling users to monitor their expenditures effectively.

## Project Overview

The application enables users to maintain traceable records of their expenses. It simplifies the process of recording and categorizing expenses, assisting users in keeping track of their financial transactions and history.

### Features

- **Expense Management:** Users can input expense amounts, names, and categories for efficient tracking.
- **Category-based Income-Expense Tracking:** The system allows for the categorization of expenses, providing a detailed overview of income and expenditures based on different categories.
- **Record Keeping:** Expensify maintains records, expenses, and historical data, facilitating easy access to past financial information.

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database used for storing application data.
- **Express.js:** Backend web application framework for Node.js.
- **React.js:** Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side operations.
- **HTML & CSS:** Standard markup and styling languages for structuring and designing the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling the user interface.
